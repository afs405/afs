              During my time at Superblack Software LTD, I had the opportunity to
              work on several exciting projects with a talented team of
              developers. One of our most successful endeavors involved creating
              Babylon.js game projects, where we utilized Unity to create
              intricate maps and environments. We also utilized React with
              Babylon.js to create a unique user experience that responded to
              audio dialogue, immersing users in an interactive narrative.

            <p>
              In addition, we worked on a project that involved creating an
              interactive experience for users, allowing them to explore different
              products and their information in an interactive window. The project
              was built using Babylon.js and required a high level of attention to
              detail to ensure a seamless user experience. It was a great
              opportunity to collaborate with my colleagues and develop new skills
              while delivering high-quality, user-friendly solutions.

            <h4>To Do App </h4>
            <h4>Created August 2023 Just it Bootcamp</h4>
            <p>I created a To-Do app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks to a list, complete with a date stamp. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionality</p>
            <ol>
              <li><h4>HTML Structure:</h4>
              <p>I structured the app's user interface using HTML, which includes a table for displaying tasks and an input box for adding new tasks.</p></li>
              <li><h4>Styling with CSS</h4><br> <p>I applied CSS to style the app's elements, including buttons, input boxes, and task lists, making it visually appealing.</p></li>
              <li><h4>JavaScript Functionality:</h4>
              <p>I used JavaScript to add functionality to the app.
                When the user enters a task and presses Enter or clicks the Plus button, a new task is added to the list.
                Each task is accompanied by a "Delete" button, allowing users to remove tasks they've completed.
                The app also uses local storage to persist tasks, ensuring that they are not lost when the page is refreshed.</p></li>
